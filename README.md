# Hungman-game

https://simply-hungman-game.netlify.app/

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The game selects a random word from a dictionary, and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. Each incorrect guess leads to the drawing of a part of the hangman figure. The game ends when the player wins by guessing the word correctly or loses when the hangman figure is complete.
